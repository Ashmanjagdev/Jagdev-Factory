# Jagdev-Factory-Backend-MERN
The project is based on an E-commerce Website. This website contains a lot of tools and parts of textile machinery which are selled in real time by my own factory in Ludhiana. To order a product in the website,a person needs to sign up simply or with google and after he/she needs to add that product in Cart. the cart will give the total amount of all the products and asks for your number,address and name to deliver the order. after the checkout the person will be redirected to paytm gateway where he/she can scan the QR code and Pay the price.
If anyone wants to sell his products also in the website ,then there is a option in the Header from where a person can uload images and data of the product he wants to sell.
